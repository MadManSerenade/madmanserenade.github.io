            What do we even want on this page? We know that we want to include React and React Native, but what does that mean?
            Whatdoes that make available to us as far as options go?
            And we want Three.js as well?
            And Tailwind?
            What does that do for us?
            What sections belong on this page? How is it navigated?
            What will need to be included as far as "secondary projects"? How do we even link multiple github page projects?
            Aside from political and personal values, what belongs on a page?
            What resources do we want to make available?
            What other pages do we even want in this thing? It can literally be anything, but where do we start?
            Do we want to start with a "hero page"? What does that even mean to me?
            What do I wanna showcase? What do I want to "promote"?
            How do we organize the causes that we are interested in making known? What does it even mean to "make it known"?
